        <h1>Study Types</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
              Quick Study - You are given random questions, once you get one right you won't be asked it again. It ends when you get every question right once.
            </p>
            <p>
              Long Study - You will do multiple rounds, in every round each question in your list is asked in a random order. It ends when you get every question in a round correct.
            </p>
            <p>
              Test - You are asked each question once, regardless of whether you get it right or wrong.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h1>Settings Explanation</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
              Autocorrect - The user can choose what language they want autocorrect in or if they want it turned off.
            </p>
            <p>
              Case Sensitive - By default the program ignores whether the user input is upper or lower case, turning this on makes the program check this.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't Correct - By default the program will tell the user what the correct answer was if they got it wrong. If this setting is turned on the program won't say what the correct answer was.
            </p>
            <p>
              Re-Do - If you turn this on, when you get a question wrong the program will make you rewrite the correct answer.
            </p>
